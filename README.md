# Interaction and Concurrency Experience (ICE) Workshop

Interaction and Concurrency Experiences (ICE) is a series of international scientific meetings oriented to theoretical computer science researchers with special interest in models, verification, tools, and programming primitives for concurrent systems and complex 
interactions.
In the last few years, ICE has been a satellite workshop of [DisCoTec](https://www.discotec.org/), published  its proceedings in [EPTCS](https://eptcs.org/) and special issues in [JLAMP](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-logical-and-algebraic-methods-in-programming).

## Workflow 

### Starting a new edition

Assume that the edition is `XXXX`.

#### On github

1. Archive the previous edition (`XXX(X-1)`) (you may have to wait for the special issue to have been published to do that),
2. [Create a team called `XXXX`](https://github.com/orgs/ice-workshop/new-team),
3. Add the IceCreamers to this team,
4. [Create a repository called `iceXXXX`](https://github.com/organizations/ice-workshop/repositories/new),
5. Give the `XXXX` team admin rights on the `iceXXXX` repository, and read right on the `iceYYYY` repository, for `XXXX > YYYY`

#### On Framalist

Go to https://framalistes.org/sympa/admin/ice and update the list of admins (remove ICECreamers from `XXX(X-1)` and add ICECreamers for `XXXX`)
